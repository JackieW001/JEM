Priorities:
  1. Finish creating Player Class
  2. Create UserPlayer Class
    - overriden playCard() so that user can choose a card to play
  3. Create AI
    - playCard() method: places first card that can be played
    - playBestCard() method that will use recursion to solve for which card to place to get closer to win
  4. Create Interface
    - Display UserPlayer Cards (face up)
    - Display DrawPile
    - Display PlacePile
    - Display AI cards (face down)
  5. Create interaction between user and game
    - Choosing cards
    - Drawing cards
    - Hitting UNO! button
    - Possibly create opening menu screen where user can choose:
      - if s/he wants to go first
      - number of AI players s/he wants to go up against
