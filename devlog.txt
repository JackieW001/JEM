--Reflection--

Obstacles Overcome:
* Disagreement over project idea. We compromised and 
  were able to peacefully make a decision!

Unresolved Issues:
- We need to work on the concepts for AIPlayer and UserPlayer. Does
UserPlayer need anything new from the Player superclass?
How to create an AI for the game (Maybe look at one of our
old projects in CS?).

Cool Stuff Learned:
For loops can make instantiating variables unnecessary, but
variables can help keep code easy to read and understand.
However, if a variable that is instantiated in a class's method
isn't used at all in the method besides instantiation, the 
code would not work (it would underline it). Processing
basically helps keep code efficient. :)
