--Reflection--

Obstacles Overcome:
* Disagreement over project idea. We compromised and 
  were able to peacefully make a decision!
* Interface is finally made (rough draft)!
* AI is more easily conceptualized, decision-making skills
  are soon to be possible!

Unresolved Issues:
* AI and UserPlayer merging with the interface

Cool Stuff Learned:
* For loops can make instantiating variables unnecessary, but
  variables can help keep code easy to read and understand.
  However, if a variable that is instantiated in a class's method
  isn't used at all in the method besides instantiation, the 
  code would not work (it would underline it). Processing
  basically helps keep code efficient. :)
