--Reflection--

Obstacles Overcome:
* Disagreement over project idea. We compromised and 
  were able to peacefully make a decision!

Unresolved Issues:
* We need to work on the concepts for AIPlayer and UserPlayer. Does
  UserPlayer need anything new from the Player superclass?
  How to create an AI for the game (Maybe look at one of our
  old projects in CS?).

Cool Stuff Learned:
* For loops can make instantiating variables unnecessary, but
  variables can help keep code easy to read and understand.
  However, if a variable that is instantiated in a class's method
  isn't used at all in the method besides instantiation, the 
  code would not work (it would underline it). Processing
  basically helps keep code efficient. :)
